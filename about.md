<h1>Alexander Ivanov</h1>

<div class="row-fluid">
	<p>
		Hi there, I’m Alexander, a software developer living and working in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
		While having a full-time job, I still find time to get other stuff done, like more coding!
		I’m currently a Senior Backend Engineer at Keywords Studios.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moreover, I love rock-n-roll, football, Linux and a good IPA, in roughly that order.
