	<p>
		Hi there, I’m Alexander, a software developer living and working in <s>Saint Petersburg, Russia</s> Helsinki, Finland.
		While having a full-time job, I still find time to get other stuff done, like more coding!
		Moreover, I love rock-n-roll, football, Linux and a good IPA, in roughly that order.
